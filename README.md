Cyphora is two applications in one repository:

| # | Application | What it is | Directory |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **ACDA-SDK** | The **Autonomous Cyber Defense Agent SDK** — a general-purpose framework for building consensus-validated AI security agents. Foundation layer. Usable stand-alone. | [`acda/`](./acda) |
| **2** | **Cyphora-S1** | The **AI-native SIEM** built on ACDA-SDK — investigation, UEBA, compliance, and natural-language query agents, plus multi-vendor ingestion and SIEM integrations. Product layer. | [`cyphora_s1/`](./cyphora_s1) |

> **Public Beta.** Cyphora has been validated end-to-end against real CrowdStrike Falcon, Okta, and Palo Alto Networks telemetry. It works, and its limitations are documented honestly in [Known Issues](#known-issues). We are releasing it under the MIT license as an open-source industry contribution, and we are looking for enterprise and government security teams to break it against their own data.

---

## Why Cyphora exists

Every SOC on earth is drowning in the same three problems:

1. **Alert fatigue.** Analysts triage thousands of alerts a day; the real attack is buried in the noise, and the team burns out finding it.
2. **You can't trust a single AI to pull the trigger.** LLMs hallucinate. An AI that can disable an account or isolate a host on its own is a new, worse insider threat. One bad inference and you've DoS'd your own executive team.
3. **The good tooling is a black box you rent.** Per-event pricing, mandatory cloud egress of your most sensitive telemetry, and a model you can neither inspect nor replace.

**Cyphora is built around a single architectural conviction: no one AI model is ever given authority to act.**

Every security event is scored **independently by three separate AI models**. A weighted consensus is computed, and an action fires **only** if that consensus clears a configured threshold. If the models disagree, the system **declines to act** and surfaces the event for a human — by design, not as a fallback. This is AI safety enforced by architecture, not by a prompt asking the model to please be careful.

And because Cyphora runs on the open ACDA-SDK, you **self-host the whole thing**. No per-event billing. No mandatory cloud dependency. Bring your own model keys — or your own models. Your logs never have to leave your boundary.

### Who it's for

- **Enterprise SOC & detection-engineering teams** who want AI-accelerated triage without handing an LLM the keys to production.
- **Federal, state, and local government cyber groups** who need a self-hosted, inspectable, air-gap-capable platform with a full audit trail behind every decision.
- **Security engineers and researchers** who want a real, working, consensus-validated agent framework (ACDA-SDK) to build their own defensive automation on.

## Proof: a verified beta run, not marketing copy

The numbers below are from a **single verified run** against CrowdStrike Falcon, Okta, and Palo Alto Networks telemetry, spanning five coordinated kill-chain scenarios plus a real-format CEF sample log. Run window: **May 25 – June 2, 2026.** Every action count was independently verified by direct `grep` against the scenario and agent log files. Technical write-up by **John Chiong**.

### The core mechanism, working as designed

> **34 of 35 events passed consensus. The one that did not — a suspicious login for an admin account — scored 0.6267 average across the three models, producing a weighted consensus of 0.6895. Below the 0.75 threshold. No playbook executed, no account disabled, no IP blocked.**
>
> *That is the architecture working as intended: the system declined to act on a low-confidence signal rather than guessing.*

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Total kill-chain events processed | **35** |
| Consensus passed | **34 / 35** (97.1%) |
| Events correctly **withheld** by the consensus gate | **1** — weighted score `0.6895` < `0.75` threshold |
| Average consensus — passing events | **0.929** (range `0.894` – `0.957`) |
| Coordinated attack scenarios | **5** (ransomware, insider exfil, credential + lateral movement, LOLBin/DNS tunneling, cloud takeover) |
| Scenario steps detected & MITRE-mapped | **19 / 19** (100%) |
| MITRE ATT&CK TTPs identified | **105** across the 5 scenarios |
| Natural-language queries answered | **10 / 10** |
| UEBA behavioral events scored | **7 / 7** |
| Compliance frameworks assessed (×3 independent runs each) | **5** — SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS v4, HIPAA, NIS2 |

### Human-assisted remediation, not autonomous action

Confirmed findings trigger response playbooks — but higher-risk containment steps are **gated behind analyst approval**, never fired automatically. Every action below is tied to a specific investigated event, not a blanket rule match, and every destructive action is individually reversible.

| Response action | Count in run |
|---|---|
| `generate_incident_report` | 35× |
| `notify_soc` | 35× |
| `create_threat_alert` | 34× |
| `revoke_token` | 28× |
| `block_ip` | 28× |
| `disable_account` | 27× |
| `isolate_host` | 11× |
| `snapshot_memory` | 3× |

### Compliance automation — including where it graded itself down

The same telemetry window was independently assessed three times against all five frameworks:

- **ISO 27001** averaged the highest coverage at **83%**.
- **SOC 2** came in **lowest at 46%** — and Cyphora **flagged SOC 2 as its own primary remediation target** in its output.

We publish that 46% deliberately. It is what the tool reported about its own gaps, not a curated result. A compliance engine you can't catch understating a gap isn't one you should trust with an audit.

### One known issue, stated up front

In this run the **natural-language query parser fell back to heuristic extraction on all 10 queries** rather than structured JSON parsing. It still returned correct results, but this path is less robust for complex or ambiguous queries. It is tracked as [`NLQ-001`](#known-issues) and is being fixed before general availability. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) for the complete, unflinching list.

## Architecture at a glance

Two layers. ACDA-SDK is the engine; Cyphora-S1 is the product built on top of it **without modifying the SDK core** — the cleanest possible proof that the SDK is genuinely reusable.

## Application 1 — ACDA-SDK (the foundation)

**ACDA-SDK** (Autonomous Cyber Defense Agent SDK) is the open-source engineering foundation beneath Cyphora-S1. It provides the complete event pipeline, multi-model AI reasoning, consensus validation, pluggable action dispatch, and agent orchestration. You can build and deploy your own defensive agents on ACDA-SDK **with no Cyphora-S1 dependency at all** — it is a standalone framework.

### Agents are declarative before they are code

Every agent is defined in a YAML **Agent Definition Format (ADF)** spec. The compiler validates it against a schema and enforces hard safety constraints *before* generating a single line of Python. The YAML is the authoritative source of truth for an agent's configuration; the compiled `BaseAgent` subclass mirrors those constants and adds engine behavior in `run()`.

```yaml
agent:
  name: MyCustomThreatAgent
  version: '1.0'

triggers:
  event_types: [suspicious_login, confirmed_attack, anomaly_detected]

data_collection:
  sources: [endpoint_logs, identity_logs]
  time_window: 30m                 # s / m / h / d

reasoning:
  ai_models: [claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-opus-4-6, gpt-4o]
  task: attack_chain_analysis
  temperature: 0.15

consensus_validation:
  method: weighted_vote            # weighted_vote | majority_vote | unanimous | quorum
  threshold: 0.75                  # 0.0 – 1.0
  weights:
    claude-sonnet-4-6: 0.40
    claude-opus-4-6:   0.35
    gpt-4o:            0.25        # weights must sum to exactly 1.0

actions: [generate_incident_report, notify_soc, mitre_map]

safety_controls:
  max_runtime: 180s
  approval_required: manual        # none | manual | auto
  dry_run_mode: false
```

**Constraints the validator enforces at compile time — not at 3 a.m. in production:**

- Consensus model weights must sum **exactly** to `1.0`.
- Every `sources` key must be a registered adapter in `_ADAPTER_MAP`.
- Every `event_type` must match the `EventType` enum.
- `max_runtime` and `approval_required` must satisfy the `safety_controls` schema.

### The `acda` CLI

```bash
# Agent lifecycle
acda init MyAgent --output-dir agent_definitions/     # scaffold a new ADF YAML
acda validate agent_definitions/myagent.yaml          # validate against the ADF schema
acda build    agent_definitions/myagent.yaml \
     --output-dir generated_agents/                   # compile YAML → Python BaseAgent

# Execution & simulation (no live credentials required)
acda run InvestigationAgent -e suspicious_login --dry-run
acda simulate ransomware --dry-run
acda simulate data_exfiltration --speed 5.0 --dry-run
acda simulate lateral_movement --dry-run

# Operations
acda registry list       # all registered agents + their trigger types
acda status              # orchestrator health, queue depth, throughput stats
acda deploy myagent --namespace cyber-defense         # Kubernetes deployment
```

### Model adapters — bring your own brain

The reasoning engine ships with three adapter types in [`acda/runtime/reasoning_engine.py`](./acda/runtime/reasoning_engine.py):

| Adapter | Backend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AnthropicModelAdapter` | Claude (any `claude-*` model) via the official async SDK | Default Sonnet + Opus in the consensus ensemble. |
| `OpenAIModelAdapter` | GPT-4o / any OpenAI-compatible chat model | Uses JSON-object structured output. |
| `SimulationModelAdapter` | Deterministic offline scorer | Powers `--dry-run`, CI, and air-gapped demos with **zero** API calls. |

Any provider exposing an OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible API can be substituted in the agent YAML **without touching platform code**. Self-host an open-weights model behind a compatible endpoint and Cyphora will never call a cloud API.

---

## Application 2 — Cyphora-S1 (the SIEM)

Cyphora-S1 is the AI-native SIEM layer. It ships **four production agents**, all built on ACDA-SDK:

| Agent | Triggers on | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| **`CyphoraInvestigationAgent`** | 10 event types (`suspicious_login`, `privilege_escalation`, `credential_dump`, `lateral_movement`, `data_exfiltration`, `abnormal_file_encryption`, `confirmed_attack`, `ueba_anomaly`, …) | `AttackIntelligence` — MITRE TTPs, temporally-ordered kill chain, plain-English incident report, selected response playbook |
| **`CyphoraUEBAAgent`** | 5 event types | `UEBAReport` — `risk_score` 0–1, `risk_label`, per-feature anomaly explanations; emits `ueba_anomaly` at ≥ 0.70 |
| **`CyphoraComplianceAgent`** | `compliance_check` (weekly by default; on-demand supported) | Five framework reports **in parallel**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS v4, HIPAA, NIS2 — with a remediation-prioritized gap list |
| **`CyphoraNLQueryAgent`** | `nl_query` | Formatted markdown/narrative answer, execution time, record count — no SPL/KQL/AQL required |

### Investigation pipeline — full kill chain in under 60 seconds

### UEBA — seven behavioral anomaly features

Per-entity baselines for users, hosts, and service accounts, scored continuously:

| Feature | Detection logic | Score |
|---|---|---|
| Login outside normal hours | Login hour vs. `typical_login_hours`; flags ≥ 3h deviation, critical at ≥ 6h | 0.60–0.80 |
| Login from new IP | Source IP vs. `typical_source_ips` allowlist | 0.65 |
| Impossible travel | Geographically impossible movement given timestamps (e.g. NY → Singapore in 22 min) | ≥ 0.85 |
| Abnormal data volume | Bytes vs. EMA of `avg_bytes_per_day`; logarithmic above 5× baseline | 0.65–0.90 |
| Mass file write / encryption | Files written vs. baseline; > 5× or > 200 files = critical ransomware signal | 0.85–0.95 |
| Non-admin privilege use | Any privileged action by a user whose `has_admin_rights` baseline is `False` | 0.80 |
| Threat-intel hit | Source IP/indicator matched against live threat-intel feeds — always critical | 0.95 |

**Cold start is handled, not faked.** A tiered strategy — peer-group baseline (if ≥ 3 mature peers exist) → event-type heuristic → provisional `0.3` with an explicit `is_cold_start=True` flag — means early scores are labeled as provisional rather than presented as ground truth. Use `warmup_from_logs()` to pre-seed baselines from historical exports. UEBA becomes meaningfully reliable after ~30–90 days of operational data; treat early scores as indicative.

### Response playbooks — with a real undo button

Four built-in playbooks. Steps marked **[approval]** suspend execution and route to the `ApprovalQueue` until an authorized analyst approves, or an auto-deny timeout fires (default 300 s).

| Playbook | Steps |
|---|---|
| `ransomware_response` | `snapshot_memory` → `isolate_host` **[approval]** → `quarantine_file` **[approval]** → `notify_soc` → `pagerduty_incident` (sev ≥ high) → `generate_incident_report` |
| `credential_compromise` | `revoke_token` **[approval]** → `disable_account` **[approval]** → `block_ip` **[approval]** → `notify_soc` → `pagerduty_incident` → `generate_incident_report` |
| `data_exfiltration_response` | `block_ip` **[approval]** → `kill_process` → `isolate_host` **[approval]** → `snapshot_memory` → `pagerduty_incident` → `notify_soc` → `generate_incident_report` |
| `lateral_movement_response` | `block_ip` **[approval]** → `isolate_host` **[approval]** → `revoke_token` **[approval]** → `snapshot_memory` → `pagerduty_incident` → `notify_soc` → `generate_incident_report` |

**Rollback:** every destructive action records its inverse before executing. `rollback(execution_id)` reverses all steps in reverse chronological order:
`isolate_host ↔ un_isolate_host` · `disable_account ↔ re_enable_account` · `block_ip ↔ unblock_ip` · `revoke_token ↔ reissue_token` · `quarantine_file ↔ restore_file`.

### Compliance — five frameworks, in parallel, weighted

| Framework | Controls covered |
|---|---|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | CC6.1–CC6.3, CC6.7, CC7.1–CC7.3, CC8.1, CC9.1 |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | A.5.15, A.5.23, A.8.5, A.8.7, A.8.15, A.8.16 |
| **PCI-DSS v4.0** | Req 1.3, 7.2, 8.2, 10.2, 10.7, 12.10 |
| **HIPAA** | §164.312(a)(1), (b), (c)(1), (e)(1) |
| **NIS2 (EU 2022/2555)** | Art.21 (a), (b), (e), (g), (h), (i) |

All five run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`. Scores reflect **weighted** control coverage across a configurable telemetry lookback (default 90 days), not a naive satisfied/total ratio. Evidence packages require qualified auditor or compliance-officer review before formal regulatory submission — Cyphora accelerates the evidence collection, it does not replace the auditor.

---

## How it works — the five-stage pipeline

Every event — regardless of source or agent — flows through the same pipeline. This uniformity is why the SDK is reusable and why the audit trail is complete.

| Stage | Component | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Ingest** | Source adapters | A CEF file, live API, or simulated adapter populates a `SecurityEvent`. Register adapters with `register_cef_adapters()` / `register_all_adapters()` / `register_simulated_adapters()`. |
| **2. Collect** | `DataCollector.collect()` | Queries every registered adapter for the surrounding time window (default 30 min). Returns a `CollectedData` object. |
| **3. Reason** | `ReasoningEngine.run()` | Dispatches to each configured model **in parallel**. Returns a `ReasoningResult` with a per-model `ModelScore` (score, label, confidence, latency, reasoning preview). Every score is logged for audit. |
| **4. Consensus** | `ConsensusValidator.validate()` | Applies `weighted_vote` / `majority_vote` / `unanimous` / `quorum`. Returns `ConsensusResult(passed: bool, score, explanation)`. |
| **5. Act** | `ActionExecutor.run()` | Fires actions **only if consensus passed**. High-risk actions route to the `ApprovalQueue` and suspend until an analyst decides or the auto-deny timeout elapses. |

---

## The consensus engine, in detail

This is the safety-critical heart of the system, so here is exactly what it computes. From [`acda/runtime/consensus_validator.py`](./acda/runtime/consensus_validator.py):

**Weighted vote (production default):**

```
                Σ (weightᵢ × confidenceᵢ)
consensus =  ─────────────────────────────      →   act only if consensus ≥ threshold
                     Σ weightᵢ
```

This is precisely the math behind the withheld event in the verified run: the admin-login event scored `0.6267` average across the three models, which — under the configured Sonnet 0.40 / Opus 0.35 / GPT-4o 0.25 weighting — produced a weighted consensus of **0.6895**, below the `0.75` threshold. **No action fired.** The system chose to be uncertain out loud rather than confident and wrong.

| Method | Rule | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `weighted_vote` | `Σ(wᵢ·confidenceᵢ) / Σwᵢ ≥ threshold` | **Production default.** Ships Sonnet 0.40 / Opus 0.35 / GPT-4o 0.25. |
| `majority_vote` | > 50% of models individually score ≥ threshold | Lower-risk, high-throughput actions. |
| `unanimous` | **All** models must score ≥ threshold | Highest-impact containment: host isolation, account disable. |
| `quorum` | ≥ a configurable fraction (default 67%) agree | Medium-risk actions needing 2-of-3. |

Guardrails built into the validator: a hard `min_models_required` floor (fails closed if too few models responded), an `asyncio.timeout` on the whole validation (a hung provider fails closed, it does not hang the SOC), and a full per-model breakdown string in every `ConsensusResult.explanation` for audit. Every individual model's score, confidence, latency, and a 300-char reasoning preview are emitted in the `reasoning_complete` log event — a complete per-model audit trail for every AI-assisted decision, which is what SOC 2 CC6.1 and HIPAA §164.312(b) actually require.

## Log formats & integrations

### Ingest formats

| Format | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **CEF (Common Event Format)** | ✅ Native | Full spec: multi-line syslog wrapping, `csNLabel`/`csN` resolution, escaped pipes, epoch-ms timestamps. Verified dialects for CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Okta. |
| **Structured JSON** | ✅ Native (live API) | Direct ingestion of nested JSON via live connectors (CloudTrail, MS Graph, GCP Logging, …). |
| OCSF · LEEF · Syslog RFC 5424 · ECS · Windows EVTX | 📋 Planned | Prioritized community-contribution targets — see [Roadmap](#roadmap--contribution-priorities). |

### CEF — verified vendor dialects

| Vendor | Vendor string | Key custom fields |
|---|---|---|
| **CrowdStrike Falcon** | `CrowdStrike` | `cs1`=DetectId, `cs2`=Technique, `cs3`=Tactic, `cs4`=ProcessName, `cs5`=ParentProcess, `cs6`=MitreTechnique |
| **Palo Alto / Cortex XDR** | `Palo Alto Networks` | `cs1`=AlertId, `cs6`=MitreTechnique |
| **Okta** | `Okta` | `cs1`=SessionId |

### Live API connectors — 7 sources

`AWSCloudTrailAdapter` · `AzureADAdapter` (Entra ID / Graph) · `OktaAdapter` · `CrowdStrikeAdapter` · `PaloAltoAdapter` (PAN-OS XML API) · `GitHubAuditAdapter` · `GCPAuditAdapter`. Each requires only least-privilege read scopes; see [Configuration](#configuration).

### SIEM connectors — 6 platforms, bidirectional

Inbound alert polling **plus** write-back of AI findings to the originating alert record:

| Platform | Ingest | Write-back |
|---|---|---|
| **Splunk ES** | polls `Cyphora_Notable_Events` saved search | updates notable-event fields |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | polls open Incidents (Graph API) | adds Incident comment |
| **IBM QRadar** | polls open Offenses (REST v19) | adds Offense note |
| **Elastic Security** | queries open signals (Kibana Detection Engine) | adds signal tags |
| **Google Chronicle SOAR** | polls open cases | adds case comment |
| **Exabeam Advanced Analytics** | polls sessions with risk ≥ 90 | log-only (no write-back API) |

Fields written back (prefixed `cyphora_` to avoid collisions): `cyphora_confidence_score`, `cyphora_mitre_ttps`, `cyphora_kill_chain_steps`, `cyphora_severity`, `cyphora_recommended_actions`, `cyphora_analyst_report`, `cyphora_case_url`, `cyphora_enriched`.

## Quick start

### Requirements

| | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | **3.11** | 3.12 recommended. Uses `asyncio`, walrus, PEP 604 unions. 3.10 and below unsupported. |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB recommended. **No local model weights** — inference is API-based. |
| OS | Linux Ubuntu 22.04+ | macOS 13+ and Windows 11 + WSL2 supported. |
| Network | Outbound 443 | To `api.anthropic.com` (and optionally `api.openai.com`) — or point at your own self-hosted endpoint. |
| Redis | Optional | Strongly recommended in production for UEBA baseline persistence & multi-replica correctness. Falls back to in-memory automatically. |

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yousource-ai/cyphora.git        # confirm URL at publish time
cd cyphora

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate            # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .                                              # installs the `acda` CLI

acda --help                                                   # verify
```

### Minimal `.env`

At minimum an Anthropic key is required. **Any log source you leave unconfigured is automatically served by a product-faithful simulated adapter**, so you can run the whole platform end-to-end with zero real credentials.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...        # required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                     # optional — enables GPT-4o (25% consensus weight)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0        # optional — blank falls back to in-memory
CYPHORA_DRY_RUN=1                          # recommended for evaluation: no live containment
CYPHORA_CEF_LOG=data/sample_security_logs.cef
```

> Never commit `.env` — it is already in `.gitignore`. In production use Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets.

### First run — no live credentials needed

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)

# Analyze the bundled 17-event mixed-vendor CEF sample (CrowdStrike + Palo Alto + Okta)
python examples/run_cef_analysis.py --dry-run --verbose

# Or your own export:
python examples/run_cef_analysis.py --log-file /path/to/export.cef --dry-run --verbose
```

See [`examples/`](./examples) for per-agent entry points (investigation, UEBA, NL query, compliance) and [`k8s/deployment.yaml`](./k8s/deployment.yaml) for the HA Kubernetes reference (2-pod orchestrator, HPA-scaled investigation agents 2–20, least-privilege RBAC, egress-443-only NetworkPolicy).

---

## Configuration

Cyphora is configured entirely through environment variables — nothing sensitive lives in code. The full reference (every AI key, CEF path, live-API credential pair, and platform flag) is documented inline in each adapter's docstring. Key rules:

- **Credential pairs are all-or-nothing.** Setting `OKTA_DOMAIN` without `OKTA_API_TOKEN` skips the adapter (logged as `adapter_skipped_missing_credentials`) rather than half-initializing.
- **Adapter registration order matters:** always call `register_all_adapters()` *before* `register_simulated_adapters()`, so simulated adapters only fill slots a live adapter didn't claim.
- **`CYPHORA_DRY_RUN=1`** disables all real containment actions and PagerDuty alerts — use it for every evaluation.

---

## Testing

The suite contains **63 security events** (46 synthetic + 17 real-format CEF) across 5 coordinated kill-chain scenarios, per-agent capability tests, and negative tests that must **not** trigger investigations (false-positive suppression).

```bash
# Full run — all agents, all scenarios (start here, dry-run + verbose)
python tests/run_cyphora_test_suite.py --dry-run --verbose

# A single scenario or agent
python tests/run_cyphora_test_suite.py --scenario S1_RANSOMWARE --verbose
python tests/run_cyphora_test_suite.py --agent CyphoraInvestigationAgent

# pytest unit tests + coverage
pytest tests/ -v --asyncio-mode=auto
pytest tests/ --cov=acda --cov=cyphora_s1 --cov-report=term-missing
```

| Scenario | Steps | Kill chain |
|---|---|---|
| S1 — Ransomware | 5 | Macro → C2 beacon → PsExec lateral → Mimikatz LSASS dump → BlackCat encryption (8,741 files @ 148/s) |
| S2 — Insider exfil | 4 | Impossible travel NY→SG (22 min) → Org Admin grant → 2.8 GB 7z archive → Dropbox DLP hit |
| S3 — Credential + lateral | 4 | MFA fatigue (47 attempts) → LSASS handle → SMB scan (312 hosts) → WMI exec to 5 servers |
| S4 — LOLBin + DNS tunnel | 3 | certutil download → scheduled-task persistence → iodine DNS tunneling |
| S5 — Cloud takeover | 3 | Credential stuffing → 40 GPU cryptomining instances → 12 backdoor IAM admins → CloudTrail disabled |

## Known issues

Documented from the beta evaluation and a full codebase review (v2.6). Contributions closing these are **especially** welcome — each maps to a [roadmap item](#roadmap--contribution-priorities).

| ID | Severity | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GAP-C1` | Critical | `cef_parser.py` | CEF vendor coverage limited to CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, Okta. Other vendors → `vendor='unknown'`, losing MITRE extraction precision. |
| `GAP-C2` | Critical | Ingest | No native Syslog (RFC 3164/5424) or JSON-Lines **file** parser. Non-CEF sources need live API connectors — a direct constraint on **air-gapped** deployments. |
| `GAP-C3` | Critical | Ingest | No LEEF file parser. `QRadarConnector` polls live but cannot process historical LEEF exports. |
| `GAP-H1` | High | `cef_parser.py` | Timestamp reads only `rt=`; vendors using `start=`/`end=`/`deviceCustomDate1=` fall back to `datetime.now()`, corrupting time-window filtering and UEBA timelines. |
| `GAP-H2` | High | `cef_parser.py` | Generic class-ID event-type resolution can misfire for unknown vendors, triggering unnecessary (billable) AI investigations. |
| `GAP-H3` | High | SIEM connectors | All six `normalise()` methods map only a subset of fields; the AI receives sparser context than from live adapters. |
| `GAP-H4` | High | SIEM connectors | ArcSight and Sumo Logic connectors are absent. |
| `NLQ-001` | Medium | `nl_query_engine.py` | All 10 beta queries fell back to heuristic extraction (`nl_parse_failed_using_heuristics`) instead of structured JSON parsing. Results correct; path less robust. **In progress.** |
| `GAP-M1` | Medium | Ingest | No event deduplication — overlapping file + live-API ingest can double-investigate. |
| `GAP-M2` | Medium | Ingest | No rate limiting on file ingest — large historical exports can exhaust LLM API limits and the 200-agent concurrency cap. |
| `GAP-M3` | Medium | UEBA | Without Redis, baselines reset on restart; multi-replica deployments without Redis produce split anomaly scores. |

## Roadmap & contribution priorities

These are the highest-impact places to contribute — each closes a known issue against the existing `BaseParser` / `SIEMConnector` interfaces:

- **More CEF vendor dialects** (`GAP-C1`) — Fortinet, SentinelOne, Cisco, Check Point, Trend Micro.
- **`SyslogParser` + `JSONLinesParser`** (`GAP-C2`) — with an ECS field-mapping preset; unblocks air-gapped ingest.
- **`LEEFParser`** (`GAP-C3`) — IBM QRadar historical file analysis.
- **CEF timestamp resolution chain** (`GAP-H1`) — `rt=` → `start=` → `end=` → `deviceCustomDate1=` → syslog header → `now()` with an `is_synthetic_timestamp` flag.
- **Deeper SIEM `normalise()`** (`GAP-H3`) and **ArcSight / Sumo Logic connectors** (`GAP-H4`).
- **Windows EVTX parser** — EventID 4624 → `suspicious_login`, 4688 → `abnormal_process_execution`, 4768/4769 → `credential_dump`, 7045 → `privilege_escalation`.
- **NLQ structured-parser fix** (`NLQ-001`).

**Off-limits without prior maintainer discussion:** changes to core consensus logic, anything that weakens or bypasses the `ApprovalQueue` for high-risk actions, and new model integrations not evaluated for consensus-weight compatibility. The safety architecture is the product.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `acda: command not found` | venv inactive or `pip install -e .` not run. `source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .` |
| `consensus.passed=False` for everything | Usually `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` missing → reasoning returns low placeholder scores. Verify egress: `curl -I https://api.anthropic.com`. |
| CEF parse returns 0 records | File has no `CEF:`-prefixed lines, or non-UTF-8 encoding. `head -5 file.cef`. |
| Everything shows `vendor='unknown'` | Vendor string isn't in `_VENDOR_MAP`. Accepted: `crowdstrike`, `palo alto networks`, `paloaltonetworks`, `okta`. Add mappings for others. |
| Adapters show simulated data despite credentials | `register_simulated_adapters()` ran before `register_all_adapters()`. Reverse the order. |
| UEBA baselines reset on restart | `REDIS_URL` unset. `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine && export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`. |

## Contributing

We welcome contributions. Before writing code, please **open a GitHub issue** describing the change and await maintainer acknowledgment — this prevents duplicate effort and aligns on approach up front. Standards for every PR:

- Python 3.11+ syntax throughout; type annotations on all public functions; Pydantic v2 models for all data structures.
- `asyncio`-native implementations for all I/O; no bare `except:` clauses.
- New ingestion paths must mirror the existing pipeline so they are operationally interchangeable with `cef_parser.py` / `cef_adapters.py`.
- Any YAML consensus weights must sum to exactly `1.0`.
- **Tests are required** — new parsers must cover vendor identification, event-type mapping, timestamp parsing, and field extraction. Add to `tests/`.
